# Pokemon Card Website - Issue Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Server Port Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple instances of the server were running on the same port, causing errors like "Port 8080 already in use"
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote the server port handling to properly check if ports are in use and gracefully find available ports
- **Files Changed**: `frontend/server.js`

### 2. Emergency Mode Not Properly Activated
- **Problem**: Emergency mode for local development wasn't automatically enabled, causing API connectivity issues
- **Fix**: Created a new init.js script that automatically enables emergency mode for localhost
- **Files Changed**: 
  - Created `frontend/js/init.js`
  - Updated `frontend/index.html` to load init.js first
  - Modified `frontend/js/api.js` to properly check for emergency mode

### 3. Debugging Tools Missing
- **Problem**: It was difficult to diagnose what was happening with the website
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive debug tools showing which elements exist and if event handlers are working
- **Files Changed**: Created `frontend/js/debug.js` 

### 4. Script Loading Order
- **Problem**: Scripts were loaded in a non-optimized order
- **Fix**: Reorganized script loading so that initialization happens first
- **Files Changed**: Updated `frontend/index.html`

### 5. API Client Issues
- **Problem**: The API client wasn't properly handling emergency mode
- **Fix**: Updated the API client to properly initialize emergency mode and handle API endpoints
- **Files Changed**: `frontend/js/api.js`
